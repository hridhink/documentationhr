        <h3 style="color:antiquewhite"> object oriented programming</h3>
        <p style="color:antiquewhite">Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch,
          etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.
          It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:

          Object
          Class
          Inheritance
          Polymorphism
          Abstraction
          Encapsulation
          Apart from these concepts, there are some other terms which are used in Object-Oriented design:

          Coupling
          Cohesion
          Association
          Aggregation
          Composition</p>

      <section class="section2" id="object">
        <h3 style="color:antiquewhite">OBJECTS</h3>
        <p style="color:antiquewhite">Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example, a
          chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike, etc. It can be physical or logical.

          An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes up some space in
          memory. Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code. The only necessary
          thing is the type of message accepted and the type of response returned by the objects.

          Example: A dog is an object because it has states like color, name, breed, etc. as well as behaviors like
          wagging the tail, barking, eating, etc.</p>

      <section class="section3" id="class">
        <h2 style="color:antiquewhite">Class</h2>
        <p style="color:antiquewhite">A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
          It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. In general, class
          declarations can include these components, in order:

          Modifiers: A class can be public or has default access (Refer this for details).
          class keyword: class keyword is used to create a class.
          Class name: The name should begin with an initial letter (capitalized by convention).
          Superclass(if any): The name of the class’s parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A
          class can only extend (subclass) one parent.
          Interfaces(if any): A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the
          keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.
          Body: The class body surrounded by braces.</p>

        <h3 style="color:antiquewhite"> POLYMORPHISM</h3>
        <P style="color:antiquewhite">Object-Oriented Programming has different concepts allowing developers to build
          logical code. One of these concepts is polymorphism. But what is polymorphism? Let’s discuss.

          Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) and describes situations in
          which something occurs in several different forms. In computer science, it describes the concept that you can
          access objects of different types through the same interface. Each type can provide its own independent
          implementation of this interface.

          To know whether an object is polymorphic, you can perform a simple test. If the object successfully passes
          multiple is-a or instanceof tests, it’s polymorphic. As described in our post about inheritance, all Java
          classes extend the class Object. Due to this, all objects in Java are polymorphic because they pass at least
          two instanceof checks.

        <h3 style="color:antiquewhite">ENCAPSULATION</h3>
        <p style="color:antiquewhite">Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming
          (OOP). Let’s examine how it’s
          done and unwrap some examples for this concept.

          By definition, encapsulation describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one
          unit, like a class in Java. This concept is also often used to hide the internal representation, or state of
          an object from the outside. This is called information hiding.

          The general idea of this mechanism is simple. For example, you have an attribute that is not visible from the
          outside of an object. You bundle it with methods that provide read or write access. Encapsulation allows you
          to hide specific information and control access to the internal state of the object.

          If you’re familiar with any object-oriented programming language, you probably know these methods as getter
          and setter methods. As the names indicate, a getter method retrieves an attribute and a setter method changes
          it. Depending on the methods that you implement, you can decide if an attribute can be read and changed. You
          may also control if the attribute is read-only or not visible at all. Later, we’ll show you how the setter
          method can also be used to implement additional validation rules to ensure that your object always has a valid
          state.

          Let’s take a look at an example that shows the concept of encapsulation in Java. This example implements
          information hiding and applies additional validation before changing the values of your object attributes.</p>

        <h3 style="color:antiquewhite">DATA ABSTRACTION</h3>

        <P style="color:antiquewhite">What Is Data Abstraction?
          Data abstraction is the programming process of creating a data type, usually a class, that hides the details
          of the data representation in order to make the data type easier to work with. Data abstraction involves
          creating a representation for data that separates the interface from the implementation so a programmer or
          user only has to understand the interface, the commands to use, and not how the internal structure of the data
          is represented and/or implemented.

          Smartphone Example
          An example in the real-world is a mobile or smartphone. The typical smartphone user does not know how calls
          are made, or how the phone accesses the Internet, or even how data is stored in the phone. Instead, the mobile
          or smartphone user is provided with an interface that hides these details from them. Making a call simply
          involves selecting a contact's phone number. Accessing the Internet involves selecting an icon on the screen.

          The user does not need to understand the details of how a phone call is placed or how the Internet works.
          These details are abstracted away from the phone's interface in order to make the phone easier and more
          effective to use. The design of the mobile or smartphone clearly separates the interface from the
          implementation. The user can learn the functions of the phone without ever having to know anything about how
          the phone works internally.

          Automobile Example
          Another real-life example is an automobile. Most people today know how to operate an automobile without
          knowing anything about how the internal combustion engine works or how the transmission works. There was a
          time when most automobile users did have to know something about these details, but as automobile technology
          improved, the details of the engine and other working parts were abstracted away so that the driver primarily
          only has to know how to start a car, how to make the car go and stop, how to steer the car, and how to add
          gasoline when the gas tank is empty.

          The automatic transmission is another example of abstraction. When cars were first produced, they only had
          manual transmissions, and all car drivers had to learn how to shift the gears of the transmission in order for
          the car to move forward or backward. Over time, the introduction of the automatic transmission abstracted away
          this layer of knowledge about the implementation of the automobile, making</P>

        <h3 style="color:antiquewhite"> FUNCTION OVERLOADING</h3>
        <P style="color:antiquewhite">Two or more functions can have the same name but different parameters; such
          functions are called function
          overloading.

          C++ has many features, and one of the most important features is function overloading. It is a code with more
          than one function with the same name having various types of argument lists. This argument list includes the
          data type of arguments and the sequence of the arguments.

          The function overloading in c++ feature is used to improve the readability of the code. It is used so that the
          programmer does not have to remember various function names. If any class has multiple functions with
          different parameters having the same name, they are said to be overloaded. If we have to perform a single
          operation with different numbers or types of arguments, we need to overload the function.

          In OOP, function overloading is known as a function of polymorphism. The function can perform various
          operations best on the argument list. It differs by type or number of arguments they hold. By using a
          different number of arguments or different types of arguments, the function can be redefined. </P>

        <h3 style="color:antiquewhite">FUNCTION OVERRIDING</h3>
        <p style="color:antiquewhite">A function is a constituent piece of code that performs a specific task in a
          program. Now, to understand
          function overriding, you must understand inheritance first, as implementing inheritance is mandatory to
          override a function. Inheritance is one of more vital concepts of OOPs that allows a derived class to inherit
          the properties of its parent class. Function overriding provides you with a way to override an existing
          functionality of a class inside a particular derived class. This can be useful when a child class requires its
          own version of a functionality.

          Now, understand this with the help of an example. Consider a vehicle manufacturing company “Ford”. A “Car”
          manufactured by this company inherits properties like brand name and vehicle type i.e. “Four Wheeler” from it.
          However, the “Car” can have a more specific vehicle type like “Sports vehicle”. So, the vehicle type function
          of the class “Ford” can be overridden in the class “Car” having its own definition of the function.

          Function Overriding in C++
          Function overriding in C++ is a concept by which you can define a function of the same name and the same
          function signature (parameters and their data types) in both the base class and derived class with a different
          function definition. It redefines a function of the base class inside the derived class, which overrides the
          base class function. Function overriding is an implementation of the run-time polymorphism. So, it overrides
          the function at the run-time of the program.

        <h3 style="color:antiquewhite">DATA BINDING</h3>
        <p style="color:antiquewhite">What is meant by data binding? Data binding is the process that establishes a
          connection between the app UI
          and the data it displays. Data binding can also mean that if an outer representation of the data in an element
          changes, then the underlying data can be automatically updated to reflect the change.

          What is data binding and its types? A discussion of the four important types of data binding in Angular
          applications: string interpolation, property binding, event binding, and two-way data binding. String
          Interpolation. Property Binding. Event Binding. Two-Way Data Binding.

          WHAT IS DATA BINDING IN OOP? – RELATED QUESTIONS
          What is data binding in C++?
          Binding refers to the process of converting identifiers (such as variable and performance names) into
          addresses. Binding is done for each variable and functions. For functions, it means that matching the call
          with the right function definition by the compiler. It takes place either at compile time or at runtime.
